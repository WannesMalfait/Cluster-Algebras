# Cluster Algebras

This repository contains all the LaTeX code for my thesis.

## Instructions

If you want to view the PDF, there are two options:

1. Compile the PDF from source. Clone/download the source files, and then compile the `cluster_algebras.pdf` file. All packages used are either from texlive, or included in the source files.
2. Download the PDF directly. Go to the “Actions” tab, and look for the latest successful “Workflow”. Clicking on it should show a downloadable zip file under “Artifacts”.
